Advent of Code 2019. Just me practising Scala!

To create a new day's main and test folders, run:
 
 ```
create-day.sh <DAY> <CLASS_NAME>
 ```
  
 Where:
  * **`<DAY>`** is the day to be created (for example `1` or `23`)
  * **`<CLASS_NAME>`** is the name of the class (and corresponding test class) to be created (for example 
  `MinecartMadness`).
